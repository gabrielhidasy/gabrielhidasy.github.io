          Cake
          dulce de leche
          whipped cream
      
  
  
      
          10 eggs, separated by whites and yolks
          1 ¼ cup white sugar
          8 ounces heavy whipping cream
      
      
          2 cups white sugar, divided
          4 cups milk
          2 Tbsp sugar
      
      
          9.75 ounces all purpose flour
          ¼ tsp baking soda
          1 tsp vanilla extract
      
      
          3 tsp baking powder
          
          
      
      
          1/2 tsp salt
          
          
      
      
          2/3 cup milk
          
          
      
      
          1.5 tsp vanilla extract
          
          
      
      
          Vegetable oil (for greasing pans)
          
          
      
      
          1 14oz. can sweetened condensed milk
          
          
      
      
          1 12ox. can evaporated milk
          
          
      
      
          4 ounces whole milk
          
          
      
      
          Thinly sliced strawberries (for garnish)
          
          
      
  

Method (makes two single-layer cakes)

Separate 10 eggs, putting the whites into the bowl of a stand mixer. Set the yolks aside.
Beat the whites on high speed with the whisk attachment of the stand mixer while slowly adding 1 cup of
white sugar. Keep whipping until stiff peaks form.
In a separate stand mixer bowl, beat the egg yolks with the other cup of sugar, mixing on medium speed
with the paddle attachment for about 2 minutes - until pale and smooth.
In a separate bowl, combine all purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk to combine.
Add 2/3 cup milk to the egg yolk mixture along with 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Mix until completely
combined. Next, add the bowl of dry ingredients and mix until completely combined.
Next, add the egg white meringue to the other bowl. Gently stir to combine, being careful not to
deflate the egg whites.
Prepare your baking pans. First, cut your parchment paper into rounds for the bottom of your pan. Watch
the video to see how I do it! Then, grease both pans with vegetable oil.
Pour the batter evenly between the two pans. Spread to smooth out the top.
Bake at 350°F for 25-35 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.
While the cake is baking, make the dulce de leche.
To make the dulce de leche, combine 1 ¼ cup sugar, 4 cups milk, and ¼ tsp baking soda into a
saucepan. Stir gently to combine over a medium heat until it comes to a rolling boil.
Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 90 minutes, whisking frequently to prevent scorching. It
should reach a deep golden brown color. Once it is finished, strain through a fine mesh sieve and
allow to cool at room temperature for at least one hour.
Once the cakes have cooled, remove them from pan and remove parchment paper. Put the cakes back in
their respective pans. Poke holes along the top of both cakes with a fork.
In a bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and whole milk.
Ladle the tres leches mixture over top of the cakes. Cover the cakes and refrigerate for at least 6
hours, preferably overnight.
Make the whipped cream: in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, combine heavy whipping
cream, sugar, and vanilla extract. Beat over medium speed until stiff peaks form.
Place one later cake onto a cake stand or plate.  Cover with whipped cream all over. Top with a
drizzle of dulce de leche, and then garnish with sliced strawberries. Serve and enjoy!

their respective pans. Poke holes along the top of both cakes with a fork.</li><li>In a bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and whole milk.</li><li>Ladle the tres leches mixture over top of the cakes. Cover the cakes and refrigerate for at least 6
hours, preferably overnight.</li><li>Make the whipped cream: in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, combine heavy whipping
cream, sugar, and vanilla extract. Beat over medium speed until stiff peaks form.</li><li>Place one later cake onto a cake stand or plate. Cover with whipped cream all over. Top with a
drizzle of dulce de leche, and then garnish with sliced strawberries. Serve and enjoy!</li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><ul class=share-buttons><li><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share Tres Leches Cake on x"
